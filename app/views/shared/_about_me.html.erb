          <p>My life has slowly been leading me to the realization that my ability to learn can be trained and optimized. That it's not something we're necessarily born with or aquire magically.
           It's a mind set, a commitment to a way of approaching life,<strong> and mostly it's hard work</strong>. These thoughts, though I didn't quite understand them yet, increasingly began to caputure my imagination and soon I devised a master plan.
           </p>
           <p>I quit my job in Pennsylvania (I had been unhappily grinding my way up the hospitality industry for the past 8+ years) and I found myself with a way plane ticket to Italy. I landed in Torino with only
           the clothes I was wearing, a backpack with a few essentials, and a small amount of money I had saved up. I didn't know anyone, speak the language, or even have a place to sleep that night.
           Like I said... "master plan". And just like that my journey began.</p>
